Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project works similar to TikTok, but is made for studying. Instead of scrolling watching random videos, scroll through questions of the Greek SATs with the 
ability to view the answers anytime you wish. 

Currently it only features math, but the goal is to expand it covering most of the lessons required in Greek SATs.
